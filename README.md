## Detecting Fake News with Python and Machine Learning

🔍 **Detecting Fake News with Python and Machine Learning**

Do you trust all the news you hear from social media? 🤔 Not all news is real, but Python can help you distinguish between real and fake news. 

🚀 **Project Overview:**
In this advanced Python project, we build a model to classify news as REAL or FAKE using:
- **TfidfVectorizer**: Converts text into TF-IDF features to identify significant terms.
- **PassiveAggressive Classifier**: An online learning algorithm that updates itself based on classification outcomes.

📊 **Dataset**: A political news dataset with labels indicating REAL or FAKE news.

🔧 **Steps Involved**:
1. Import necessary libraries.
2. Load and explore the dataset.
3. Split data into training and testing sets.
4. Vectorize the text data.
5. Train the classifier.
6. Evaluate the model with accuracy score and confusion matrix.

📈 **Results**: Achieved an accuracy of 92.82% in detecting fake news!
